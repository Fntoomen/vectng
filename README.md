# weirdWindowsXPGame

## I try to rewrite that one game from Windows XP. My friend doesn't remember the name of it, but he has footage of him playing that game and would love to play it again. I write it from scratch just based on the footage that I got. I will use different sprites/textures from the original game. I will use SDL2 and C++ to write it, without any game engine, just graphics library and C++ code.
